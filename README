  INTRODUCTION
----------------

ArduinoVM is a framework for hardware testing: it provides a
x86 like virtual machine environment to run programs on the board's RAM
of the AVR microcontroller instead of the FLASH memory:

this allows you to test the code fast, and preserve the flash memory,

Not all Arduino functionalities are supported at the moment except
for digitalRead, digitalWrite, pinMode, Serial print and timing functions.

---------
  USAGE
---------

1- open this project ArduinoVM.ino with Arduino
2- Upload sketch

Build the compiler: 
  $ cd tools
  $ make compiler

Then to compile one of the examples:
  $ ./compiler ../examples/blink

Which will produce ../examples/blink.bin that you can
turn into a string of bytes with hexdump:

  $ hexdump -e '32/2 "%04x" "\n"' blink.bin

Finally copy and paste the output to the serial monitor
of Arduino or whichever you're using.

--------
  TODO
--------
This project just started out, and so, there are a lot of things still to be done,
some examples:

|- write the documentation
|- write better code for some functions like VM::Compile
|- improve the compiler.cpp : add labels, includes,
|- add more instructions to the VM: from to every register,
   dereference of stack memory
|- completition of the tests

 PARTICIPATE
-------------
If you like the project and would like to contribute, don't hesitate! This is
a hobby project, so every contribution makes a difference

------
 HELP 
------
Given the fact that the assembler is very rudimental you can use this 
line command to calculate the addresses to be used with call, jmp instructions:

  $ grep "^[^#]" FILENAME | nl
